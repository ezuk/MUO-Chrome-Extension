MUO-Chrome-Extension
====================

A Chrome extension for linting MakeUseOf posts (for authors and editors).

This is a Chrome custom-built for MakeUseOf authors and editors, although other WordPress users may find it useful as well.

In a nutshell, it removes many markup artifacts that otherwise have to be manually removed from the average WordPress post. Stuff like extraneous image attributes, smart quotes, and whatnot.


Quality should be considered alpha; pull requests are more than welcome.
